MultithreadFP is a tool that measures the shared footprint 
of a multithreaded application. Three tools are included
here.

anyk-sfp : This tool measures the shared footprint for
           all sharing degrees. It only differentiates
           the thread count but not the thread set.

anyk-wr-sfp : This tool is an extension of anyk-sfp. It
              not only measures the sharing degree, but
              also considers memory reference types. It
              calculates three types of shared footprints.

anyset-fp : This tool is another extension of anyk-sfp.
            Beside of measuring the shared footprint of
            all sharing degree, it computes the total 
            footprint of any thread set. It dumps the 
            stats for all thread set into text files and
            uses anyset-fp-compose script to compose 
            the footprint for a given thread set. It incurs
            a lot overhead, and only scales up to 22 threads

These tools are implemented in Pin Tools 2.13 and can be 
ported to other platforms.
